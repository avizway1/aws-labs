EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud

On-Demand EC2 Instances : unpredictable workloads / usecase.. Test your application .. 
	Pricing : /hr   (or) /sec billing (with min of 10 sec)


Reserved Instances : Stable workloads.. Contrac : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs... 

	Standard RI : We cannot upgrade the configuration.
	Convertable RI : We can change the configuration in future. 
	Scheduled RI : purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis,  start time and duration, for a one-year term.
Pricing : Full Upfront : Pay 100% now (onetime cost)
Partial upfront : Pay 30-50% now.. Remaining monthly basis based on running hours
No upfront : All amount monthly basis only


Spot Instances : If our application have flexible start/stop time. 

Spot Advisor / Pricing History

2 Hr 35 Min :  Price increased and AWS terminated instance : 2 hr
	       We have terminated our instance, price not increased : 2 Hr 35 Min

AWS Marketplace : Where we can sell / buy applications. 



Instance Lau8nch : 

AMI : Amazon Machine Image (AMI) : O/S

Step 2: Choose an Instance Type : vCPU, Memory and Network performnce

General purpose : stable performance : t2, t3 , m5a, m5d, m4 and m5 
Compute Optimised : CPU : c4, c5, c5n, c5d
GPU : p2, g4dn
Memory : RAM : r4, r5, r5a, r5d, z1d
Storage Optimised: d2, i2 and i3


Step 3 : Configure Additional settings

Terminate : Delete
Stop : We can start, whenever we want to. 

Monitoring : Cloudwatch : 
	Basic Monitoring : 5 Min (Free tier), Enabled by defaultly
	Enhanced/Detailed Monitoring : 1 Min (No Free tier)

Step 6: Configure Security Group
--> No Deny

Inbound : We need to open required ports.

ports : 0-65535

ssh:22		--> Linux
rdp:3389	--> Windows
http: 80
https :443
mssql:1433
mysql:3306


Source : 0.0.0.0/0 --> Everywhere
	IPAddress --> manual
	MyIP --> Currently connected network Public ip
Outbound : allo all traffic by defaultly.


Free Tier : 750 Hrs/Month, t2.micro Windows Instance (1 x 31 days = 744 Hrs)
	    750 Hrs/Month, t2.micro Linux Instance

Storage : 30 gb



Task : Launch a Windows Instance and install IIS and deliver the webpage.

Task 2 : CHange the Administrator's password and try to use the keypair generated password.

Task 3 : Create a new user and give valid permissions to login to instance.

Task 4 : give local admin rights to newly crated user.

Launch a Linux Instance : 

ssh -i keypair.pem ec2-user@Publicip


Status Checks : 
--> System Status Check : Host level / Physical resource level issues : Stop/Start, Additional NIC card / Contact AWS

--> Instance status check : o/s level checks : reboot


IP : 

13.126.230.62

NO FREE TIER
EIP : Elastic IP : 
ENI : Elastic Network Interface : 



Task : Launch a windows instance and install iis.

Task 2 : Create a new NIC card in same AZs and associate with IIS Webserver.

Launch another ec2 instance, and try to access the IIS hosted website using private IP address.

Root Device type : 

--> Instance Store Volumes : Ephemeral storage (temporary) : 
	--> It cannot sustain underlying host failure
	--> if host failure happens, we will loss all data.
	--> We cannot stop/start the instances
	--> We can reboot.

--> EBS (Elastic Block Storage) 

IOPS : input and Output per second
root volume : OS runs in root volume : gp2, io1 and magnetic
additional volumes : st1 & sc1

--> general purpose SSD (gp2) : Min 1 Gib, Max 16 TiB, Max IOPS : 16000, 

	(1:3) 1 gb = 3 iops with Min of 100 iops/3000 bustable. 

--> Provisioned IOPS (io1) : Min 4 gib, Max 16 Tib, Max IOPS : 64000*, (32000 IOPS for regular instances) (* Nitro Instances) 

	1 gb  = 50 iops but We have an option to edit as per our requirement.

--> Magnetic (standard): Min 1 gb, Max 1 tb, IOPS N/A, Less Freq accsed data/cheapest 

--> Throughput optimised HDD (st1) : Min 500 Gb, Max 16 TB, Throughput
--> Cold HDD (sc1)
